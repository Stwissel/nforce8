nforce8 :: node.js salesforce REST API wrapper
======

This is a (hopefully) temporary fork of Kevin O'Hara's brilliant
[nforce](https://github.com/kevinohara80/nforce) library. You might want to refer to the original!

## Rationale
I'm maintaining the [NodeRED](https://nodered.org/) modules for Salesforce: [node-red-contrib-salesforce](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-salesforce). The nodes needed a more recent library version and a few patches to get it to work, so I had to fork the library.

Probably in the upcoming 2.0 release Kevin will make this fork obsolete
